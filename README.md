# PingMadeMeDoIt
Mom, ping made me do it ! Use ping to enter shell, execute commands or send data.

Use Ping IMCP 8 to send data, receive data. In our example we implemented a shell, job command and simple plain messaging. All of this in combination with some AES-256 encryption sauce.
Ping client will run as normal ping but if you supply client.exe advanced, it will start the custom ping.

Nowadays this technique is quite known but still it's a nice backup to maintain persistence access to a machine. Maybe combinate this with some windows service which calls our custom ping each 60 minutes, put it in system32\ as ping32.exe ?
